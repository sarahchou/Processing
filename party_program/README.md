 # Prompt:
This was the final version of Assignment 4 for Creative Coding:
This project will employ an outside data source:  images (photographs, drawings, video, etc.), video, text or sound files and timers to produce transformations in that data.  You could consider using an api to grab info from another application or service (e.g. Twitter or Google etc).With your piece, consider the connection between your data and how you are using and interpreting it.  This work should have a critical standpoint- that does not mean it has to offer a judgment or assessment (positive or negative) but rather that it makes visible things that might otherwise be hidden or not considered or taken for granted. You should be conscious of the tools you are using and aware of how you are using them.


# What It Does: 
Party Program is a party/concert/rave simulator! It has changing "lights" and "lasers",
different songs, and "friends"* to dance with as well as a camera on you!

# How It Works:
The screen shows video input from your webcam (get ready to see yourself partying!)
If "Friend Mode" is activated, friend images will grow and shrink according to volume
level in the song, "dancing" with you. (Note: Friend Mode makes the program much slower). 

The beat of the song affects the tint color of the screen, as well as the laser size.
Volume also controls the laser color. 

Party Program was inspired by going to see a concert with friends, and seeing a bunch of pretty lights and also thinking about missing my friends
 after this Dialogue is over. With Party Program, I can always dance and sing along with them virtually. :) * I changed the photos from pictures of my friends to pictures of the artists of the songs I chose, since this is publicly on GitHub.

### Data Input:
 "Party Program" takes in a few different forms of input: 
  - a text file with color values (HSB Hues)
  - images (of song artists)
  - live video input from computer webcam
  - song files (as MP3)

### Key Events:
 - Press any number to play a song from the track list. At any time, feel free to play DJ by pressing a different number for a different song.
 - Press "s" to see the list of songs (it's more fun as a surprise though!)
 - Press "f" to activate Friend Mode, showing images of friends to dance along with
 - Press "n" to for "No Friend" Mode (deactivating Friend Mode, making the program run at normal speed).
 - Press SPACE to pause or play the song.
